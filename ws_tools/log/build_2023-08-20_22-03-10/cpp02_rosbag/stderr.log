[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findros2bag2_cpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ros2bag2_cpp", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ros2bag2_cpp" with
  any of the following names:

    ros2bag2_cppConfig.cmake
    ros2bag2_cpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros2bag2_cpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ros2bag2_cpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ros2bag2_cpp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
